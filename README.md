### I am a undergradute majoring in [computer engineering at uw-madison](https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/computer-engineering-bs/ "Computer Engineering, B.S. < University of Wisconsin-Madison"). My interests lie in applications of machine learning to the physical world.

## Projects and Experiences
### Perdictive Model of Neutron Stars
- Liaised with Dr. Alexander Mushtukov from Oxford University to prepare research paper on neutron stars.
- Grasped complex astrophysical concepts, proficiently coded in Python, and consistently offered innovative solutions.
- Modeled simulations of neutron stars in MATLAB to predict certain features in extraneous conditions to present the results of the study in a research paper.


## Advanced Courses I've taken 
- ECE 532: Matrix Methods in Machine Learning

   Linear algebraic foundations of machine learning featuring real-world applications of matrix methods from classification and clustering to denoising and data analysis. Mathematical topics include: linear equations, regression, regularization, the singular value decomposition, and iterative algorithms. Machine learning topics include: the lasso, support vector machines, kernel methods, clustering, dictionary learning, neural networks, and deep learning. 
  
- ECE 354: Machine Organization and Programming
...An introduction to fundamental structures of computer systems and the C programming language with a focus on the low-level interrelationships and impacts on performance. Topics include the virtual address space and virtual memory, the heap and dynamic memory management, the memory hierarchy and caching, assembly language and the stack, communication and interrupts/signals, compiling and assemblers/linkers.
  
- ECE 352: Digital System Fundamentals
...Logic components, Boolean algebra, combinational logic analysis and synthesis, synchronous and asynchronous sequential logic analysis and design, digital subsystems, computer organization and design.
