## ðŸ”¬ Projects and Experiences

### Systolic Array AI Accelerator Design
Developed a low-power ASIC optimized for real-time neural network inference, leveraging a systolic array architecture with INT8 MAC operations and memory buffers to minimize latency:
- Designed finite state machines (FSMs) for precise control of data flow and timing.
- Integrated a row-stationary dataflow inspired by Googleâ€™s TPU, enhancing data reuse.
- Implemented sparsity-aware execution, skipping zero weights/activations to achieve power efficiency.

### High-Performance RISC CPU
Collaborated on designing a five-stage pipelined MIPS microprocessor with advanced performance features:
- Implemented a two-way set-associative cache to improve memory access speed.
- Included a multi-cycle memory system with register bypassing, forwarding, and branch prediction to minimize stalls.
- Designed for robust exception handling, enabling smooth control flow and supporting parallel instruction execution with a superscalar architecture.

### Self-Automated Robot Knightâ€™s Tour on a Chessboard
Built an autonomous robot to complete the Knightâ€™s Tour on a chessboard using precise control techniques:
- Employed a PID controller with PWM for accurate positioning and movement.
- Integrated UART and SPI interfaces for communication between the robotâ€™s microprocessor and sensors.
- Used Synopsys Design Vision and a 32nm library to optimize the design, with Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) constraints for reliable performance.
