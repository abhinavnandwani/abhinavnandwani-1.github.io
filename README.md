## 🔬 Projects and Experiences

### ARM-Based AI Inference Accelerator for Meta Llama 2 [Repo](https://github.com/abhinavnandwani/arm-llama2-asic)
●	Developed an ASIC on the AMD Xilinx platform for a scaled-down 50M Llama 2 model using a systolic array optimized for INT8 quantization in SystemVerilog.
●	Implemented the Llama 2 architecture from scratch in C, leveraging an ARM Cortex microprocessor. 
●	This architecture increased power efficiency by offloading intensive matrix multiplications, allowing the ARM chip to focus on general system operations.


### Pipelined RISC CPU [Repo] (https://github.com/abhinavnandwani/mips-r2000-microprocessor)
●	Designed, in collaboration, a 5-stage pipelined MIPS CPU in Verilog with control, data hazards prevention and exception handling. 
●	Integrated a two-way set-associative cache with four-banked memory and optimizations like bypassing, forwarding, and branch prediction to minimize pipeline stalls.


### Self-Automated Robot Knight’s Tour on a Chessboard
Built an autonomous robot to complete the Knight’s Tour on a chessboard using precise control techniques:
- Employed a PID controller with PWM for accurate positioning and movement.
- Integrated UART and SPI interfaces for communication between the robot’s microprocessor and sensors.
- Used Synopsys Design Vision and a 32nm library to optimize the design, with Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) constraints for reliable performance.
