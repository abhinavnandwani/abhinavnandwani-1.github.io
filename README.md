### I am a undergradute majoring in [computer engineering at uw-madison](https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/computer-engineering-bs/ "Computer Engineering, B.S. < University of Wisconsin-Madison"). My interests lie in applications of machine learning to the physical world.

## Projects and Experiences
### Simulation of Neutron Stars Project with Dr. Alexander Mushtukov at Oxford University
-Liaised with Dr. Alexander Mushtukov from Oxford University to prepare research paper on neutron stars.
-Grasped complex astrophysical concepts, proficiently coded in Python, and consistently offered innovative solutions.
-Modeled simulations of neutron stars in MATLAB to predict certain features in extraneous conditions to present the results of the study in a research paper.
