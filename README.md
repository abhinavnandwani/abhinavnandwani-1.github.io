  Bachelor of Science, Computer Engineering (Machine Learning Specialization), Computer Science Minor  
  **GPA**: 3.86/4.0  
  **Expected Graduation**: 2026


## 🔬 Projects and Experiences

### ARM-Based AI Inference Accelerator for Meta Llama 2 [Repo](https://github.com/abhinavnandwani/arm-llama2-asic)
- Developed an ASIC on the AMD Xilinx platform for a scaled-down 50M Llama 2 model using a systolic array optimized for INT8 quantization in SystemVerilog.
- Implemented the Llama 2 architecture from scratch in C, leveraging an ARM Cortex microprocessor. 
- This architecture increased power efficiency by offloading intensive matrix multiplications, allowing the ARM chip to focus on general system operations.


### Pipelined RISC CPU [Repo](https://github.com/abhinavnandwani/mips-r2000-microprocessor)
- Designed, in collaboration, a 5-stage pipelined MIPS CPU in Verilog with control, data hazards prevention and exception handling. 
- Integrated a two-way set-associative cache with four-banked memory and optimizations like bypassing, forwarding, and branch prediction to minimize pipeline stalls.


### Autonomous Robot Chip Synthesis [Repo](https://github.com/abhinavnandwani/knights-tour)
- Worked in a team of four, under Eric Hoffman’s guidance, to design an autonomous robot capable of executing the entire Knight's Tour on a chessboard, entirely at the RTL level.
- Employed a PID controller with PWM for precise movement and positioning. Utilized UART and SPI interfaces for effective communication between the robot’s components and the microprocessor.
- Simulated and Synthesized on Intel Quartus and Synopsys using a 32nm library. Applied PVT and low-level constraints, optimizing the design and meeting max and min delay slack with clock uncertainty.
